# learn-italian-verbs (ReactJS)

Recently, after two years, I resumed two of my passions: learning languages and coding. So I decided to mix those two (to get back to it) and this is what came out of it:

A simple but useful React project to practice usage of state, props and components. As well as using npm modules to extract key information (italian verbs and their conjugation) and using a front-end framework.

<h1><b>Functionality</b></h1>
You can insert any verb in italian in the input bar.
After clicking 'submit' you will see the the verb and three of its most common conjugation usages (Present simple, Preterite or past and Future simple).
<br/>

<br><b>Why only those three? </b>Because that's how I usually approach learning a new language: memorizing the most common conjugations of the verbs I will frequently use in any conversation.

**The essence of this app is extracting the italian verbs which is possible with italian-verbs and italian-verbs-dict npm packages**
